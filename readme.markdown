## Sample project demonstrating CQRS & Event Sourcing
=====================================================

The sample uses the following projects from Jonathan Oliver (https://github.com/joliver)

* EventStore
* NanoServiceBus
* CommonDomain
* StorageAccess

For more information on CQRS and Event Sourcing http://cqrsinfo.com/

## To Run The Sample

1. You need to create 3 databases in SQL Server 2008 express:
	* Sample.Subscriptions
	* Sample.EventStore
	* Sample.ReadModel

	On the Sample.Subscriptions table you need to run the lib\NanoMessageBus\SubscriptionStorage.sql to create
	the table in which NanoMessageBus will store the subscriptions.

2. You need to create 5 transactional Queues in MSMQ:
	* Sample.AppService
	* Sample.Error
	* Sample.Denormalizer
	* Sample.Client
	* Sample.ReadModel


Description of the sample Domain Models implemented:

### People
Simple domain consisting of a Person Aggregate Root and two value objects ( PersonName and Address ).
The model allows the creation of a person, the MovePerson operation witch changes the address and the kill-ing
of a person.

### Funds
Sample domain with two ARs, Document and ShareClass and some VOs that demonstrates modeling many-to-many between aggregates.
This domain is still work in progress.

A short description of the projects in the sample:

### Write Side

	1. Sample.DomainModel
		- the domain model for the sample
		- this model is persisted using event sourcing and does not need to handle reads ( queries ) 
		since they are done on the read side.
		- the resulting event stream is the "source of truth" data.

	2. Sample.AppService 
		- the handlers for the commands our domain knows to execute

	3. Sample.AppServiceHost
		- infrastructure for wiring up the command handlers to NanoServiceBus 
		- this is the actual instance of the service that needs to be running for the write side to process
		commands.

### Read Side

	1. Sample.ReadModel
		- the read model on witch queries are executed
		- this model should be mapped as close as possible to the views
		- this model can be regenerated from the event stream 

	2. Sample.Denormalizer
		- the event handlers for the domain events that are published by the DomainModel on the WriteSide
		- this handlers keep the read model in sync with the event stream
		- a better name for it is welcome

	3. Sample.DenormalizerHost
		- infrastructure for wiring up the event handlers to NanoServiceBus
		- this process needs to run for the read side to be updated.

### Infrastructure
	
	1. Sample.Messages
		- definitions for commands and events that are handled or published by the Domain Model
	
	2. Sample.Client.Web
		- ASP.NET MVC3 application that demonstrates how to integrate the WriteSide & the ReadSide in an application.


## TODO
=======

- Add more complex objects to the domain
- Review transaction management on integration points
- use ConfOrm for mapping the read model
- Add error handeling/reporting
- Create generic infrastructure to handle message/handler registration in nano message bus
- Add js pooling sample to handle eventual consistency
- Add more inter aggregate communication/operations

## Disaclaimer
==============

This sample's primary purpose is for me to gain experience with Autofac, NanoMessageBus, 
EventStore and all the other projects involved.
